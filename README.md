Blurent webpage

#Introduction

Blurent is a small company that rents out cleaning equipment. I made the webpage as a part of my internship in SoftCloud, Ltd. where I was supervised by Oliver Eding. The design was made by a design intern in the same company.

The purpose of this page is to introduce the products of the company and to have clients make bookings. 

There are two pages in the project. The main page consists of a navbar, a hero section, two product carousels, call-to-action section for clients to sign up to know more and a simple footer with contact information. The product page has an image carousel with thumbnails, an introductory section that describes the product, a calendar to take bookings, a tabbed section for introduction, longer description and a video. Below the tab section is a special discount section and the same call-to-action and a footer from the main page. 

#Technologies

The layout is made with lots of help from Bootstrap and CSS is structured using SASS. Interactive elements (the carousels, calendar and tabbed component) are made using jQuery plugins, namely Owl Carousel and jQuery UI (Datepicker and Tabs). The project is built on Webpack Frontend Starterkit (https://github.com/rdbsf/Webpack-Frontend-Starter).

#Lessons learned

Every project brings me new discoveries when using responsiveness. From this project I realized that next time, I should try to write the CSS mobile first, since the CSS for tablet and mobile views mainly requires removing desktop layout elements.

This was my first time using jQuery (plugins) so I learned a lot about how to research plugin options and how to customize a plugins' behaviour. The calendar is not working properly at the moment since I chose a wrong plugin for it. This was a huge learning moment for me and I will definitely research plugins more thoroughly in the future. 

Before my supervisor recommended to use jQuery plugins for interactive elements, I tried to code them in Vanilla JS. This was also a huge learning journey for me. I managed to do the carousels and a tabbed component but because of responsivity issues, it was smarter to use jQuery in the finished product. Calendar application proved to be too difficult for me at this point but the hours spent trying to figure it out, were definitely very educational.

#Conclusion

I am very glad that I made my first steps towards using different plugins on my webpages. Also I am getting more and more confident in coding nice modern and responsive layouts. This was my most complicated project yet and I am proud of the result.
